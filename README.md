# Kettle

This is a read me file for the main function Water Kettle.py

Challenge 1
  The device that I have chosen for the testing is a water kettle. I believe that the whole function of the water kettle can be broken down into state transitions, from the  start of switching on the kettle to the end where the water boils.

Challenge 2 (Code explanation)
there is a main function that starts the boiler
the programs starts with calling the main function, where it asks whether the user wants to boil water
they are to input Y (yes) or N (no)
(In reality, this would most probably be a switch that acts as Yes and No)
when the user inputs Y (Turns on the switch) the water will start to boil
there is a timer here, I currently put it as 0.5 seconds, but in reality this would be a 5 minute timer (or how long it takes to boil water, as a safety feature)
After that, the kettle will turn off
